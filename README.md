TwitchClips is a NodeJS program to gather highly viewed video clips from twitch.tv and post them directly to twitter.

The program will automatically gather your access token so you will not need to send an initial POST request to twitch to get started.

You will need a Twitter and Twitch development app to have all the relevant keys and tokens which need to be entered into your .env file.

Visit https://developer.twitter.com/ and https://dev.twitch.tv/ for instructions on how to obtain developer access.
